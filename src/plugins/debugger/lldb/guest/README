LLDB Guest Engine

You can use the LLDB debugger from the LLVM project with the Qt Creator debugger
plugin on Mac OS.

For the Qt Creator build to pick up the LLDB Guest Engine,
you must download the LLDB debugger and configure it
to be included in the Qt Creator build.

To debug an application, Qt Creator must access the memory of the application.
On Mac OS X, this requires code signing.

To enable LLDB debugger support in Qt Creator:

1. To download the LLDB debugger, enter the following command:
   svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lldb/trunk lldb

2. To sign the code, follow the instructions in lldb/docs/code-signing.txt.

3. To open LLDB in Xcode for building, enter the following command:
   open lldb.xcodeproj
   then select the Release target and press the build button.

4. In Xcode, press the build button.

5. type the following to have the qt creator build system find your lldb build:
   export WITH_LLDB=/path/to/lldb

6. To rebuild Qt Creator, change back to the top level directory of
   the Qt Creator source, and enter the following command:
   qmake -r && make
