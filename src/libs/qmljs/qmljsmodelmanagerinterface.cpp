    \class QmlJS::ModelManagerInterface
    \brief Interface to the global state of the QmlJS code model.
    \sa QmlJS::Document QmlJS::Snapshot QmlJSTools::Internal::ModelManager

    The ModelManagerInterface is an interface for global state and actions in
    the QmlJS code model. It is implemented by \l{QmlJSTools::Internal::ModelManager}
    and the instance can be accessed through ModelManagerInterface::instance().

    One of its primary concerns is to keep the Snapshots it
    maintains up to date by parsing documents and finding QML modules.

    It has a Snapshot that contains only valid Documents,
    accessible through ModelManagerInterface::snapshot() and a Snapshot with
    potentially more recent, but invalid documents that is exposed through
    ModelManagerInterface::newestSnapshot().
