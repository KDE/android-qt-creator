    \title Address Book Tutorial
    \brief An introduction to GUI programming with Qt and Qt Creator,
    describing in detail how to put together a simple yet fully-
    functioning application.

    This tutorial gives an introduction to GUI programming using the Qt SDK.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-screenshot.png

    In the process, you will learn about some basic technologies provided by
    Qt, such as:

    \list
        \o  Widgets and layout managers
        \o  Container classes
        \o  Signals and slots
        \o  Input and output devices
    \endlist

    All these technologies will be introduced via the Qt Creator Integrated
    Development Environment (IDE).

    If you are completely new to Qt, please read \l{How to Learn Qt} if you
    have not already done so.

    The tutorial's source code is located in Qt's
    \c{examples/tutorials/addressbook} directory.

    Although this little application does not look much like a fully-fledged
    modern GUI application, it uses many of the basic techniques that are used
    in more complex applications. After you have worked through it, we
    recommend checking out the \l{mainwindows/application}{Application}
    example, which presents a small GUI application, with menus, toolbars, a
    status bar, and so on.

    \title Address Book 1 - Designing the User Interface

    The first part of this tutorial covers the design of the basic graphical
    user interface (GUI) you use for the Address Book application.

    The first step to creating a GUI program is to design the user interface.
    In this chapter, your goal is to set up the labels and input fields needed
    to implement a basic address book application. The figure below is a
    screenshot of our expected output.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part1-screenshot.png

    Begin by launching Qt Creator and use it to generate a new project. To
    do this, select \gui{File} > \gui{New File or Project...} >
    \gui{Qt Application Project} > \gui{Qt Gui Application} and
    click \gui OK. Set your project name to \bold part1 with the QtCore and
    QtGui modules checked. Ensure that you select QWidget as your base class
    and name it \c AddressBook.

    When you click \gui Next, \e five files will be generated in this
    \gui{Project}:

    \list
        \o  \c{main.cpp} - the file containing a \c main() function, with an
            instance of \c AddressBook,
        \o  \c{addressbook.cpp} - the implementation file for the
            \c AddressBook class,
        \o  \c{addressbook.h} - the definition file for the \c AddressBook
            class,
        \o  \c{addressbook.ui} - the user interface file created with \QD,
            and
        \o  \c{part1.pro} - the project file.
    \endlist

    Now that you have all the files you need, click \gui Finish so you can
    start designing the user interface.

    \note For more details on how to create a \gui Project with Qt Creator,
    refer to \l{Creating a Project}.

    \section1 Placing Widgets on The Form

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part1-creator-screenshot.png

    In the \gui{Projects} sidebar, double-click on the \c{addressbook.ui} file.
    The \QD plugin will be launched, allowing you to design your program's user
    interface.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part1-designer-screenshot.png

    You require two \l{QLabel}s to label the input fields as well as a
    QLineEdit and a QTextEdit for the input fields. To create this follow the
    steps mentioned below:
    \list
       \o  Drag those widgets from the \gui{Widget Box} to your form.
       \o  In the \gui{Property Editor}, set their \gui{objectName} property to
           \c nameLabel and \c addressLabel for the \l{QLabel}s, \c nameLine
           for the QLineEdit and finally, \c addressText for the QTextEdit.
       \o  Position the widgets properly, according to the screenshot above.
       \o  Use a QGridLayout to position our labels and input fields in a
           structured manner. QGridLayout divides the available space into
           a grid and places widgets in the cells you specify with row and
           column numbers.
       \o  Place the caption of the \c addressLabel on the top, change the
           vertical alignment property to \c AlignTop.
    \endlist

    The figure below shows the layout cells and the position of our widgets.
    Place your widgets accordingly and save the form by choosing
    \gui{File} > \gui{Save} or use the shortcut key \key{Ctrl+S}.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part1-labeled-screenshot.png

    A common mistake when designing user interfaces with \QD is overlooking the
    top level widget's layout. Unlike sub-layouts, which \QD displays with a
    red border, top level layouts have no graphical representation. Layouts are
    necessary for top level widgets, in this case QWidget, to ensure that when
    the window is resized, the widgets on the form will resize accordingly. You
    can try this out by pressing \key{Alt+Shift+R} now. To correct it, click
    anywhere on the form and select \gui{Lay out Horizontally} or
    \gui{Lay out Vertically}. The output will be the same. Now your widgets
    will resize correctly.

    \note Refer to the \l{Layout Classes} document for more
    details on Qt's layout management classes. In addition, the
    \l{Getting to Know Qt Designer} document explains how to use
    layouts with \QD.

    \section1 The AddressBook Class

    The \l{examples/addressbook-sdk/part1/addressbook.h}{\c addressbook.h} file
    is used to define the \c AddressBook class.

    Let's take a look at what is already provided for us by Qt Creator. The
    \c AddressBook class has been defined as a QWidget subclass with a
    constructor and destructor.The Q_OBJECT macro is used to indicate that this
    class uses internationalization as well as Qt's signals and slots features.
    Although the macro implements some of Qt's more advanced features, for now,
    it is useful to think of it as a shortcut that allows us to use the
    \l{QObject::}{tr()} and \l{QObject::}{connect()} functions.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part1/addressbook.h class definition

    Qt Creator's \gui{Project Wizard} provides you with the \c Ui object as a
    way to access the widgets on our form.

    The \l{examples/addressbook-sdk/part1/addressbook.cpp}{\c addressbook.cpp}
    file is used to implement the \c AddressBook class. The constructor sets up
    the \c ui file; the destructor deletes it.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part1/addressbook.cpp class implementation


    \section1 The \c{main()} Function

    The \l{examples/addressbook-sdk/part1/main.cpp}{\c main.cpp} file contains
    the \c{main()} function  It is generated by the \gui{Project Wizard}.
    Within this function, a QApplication object, \c a, is instantiated.
    QApplication is responsible for various application-wide resources, such as
    the default font and cursor, and for running an event loop. Hence, there is
    always one QApplication object in every GUI application using Qt.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part1/main.cpp main function

    The code constructs a new \c AddressBook widget on the stack and
    invokes its \l{QWidget::}{show()} function to display it.
    However, the widget will not be shown until the application's event
    loop is started. This is done by calling the application's
    \l{QApplication::}{exec()} function. Finally, the result returned by
    \l{QApplication::}{exec()} is used as the \c main() function's return
    value.


    \section1 Running the Application

    To run your application with Qt Creator, simply click,
    \inlineimage qtcreator-run.png.
    A bare bones Address Book will be displayed.



    \section1 Qt Programming - Subclassing

    When writing Qt programs, you usually subclass Qt objects to add
    functionality. This is one of the essential concepts behind creating custom
    widgets or collections of standard widgets. Subclassing to extend or change
    the behavior of a widget has the following advantages:

    \list
        \o  You can write implementations of virtual or pure virtual functions
            to obtain exactly what you need, falling back on the base class's
            implementation when necessary.
        \o  It allows you to encapsulate parts of the user interface within a
            class, so that the other parts of the application do not need to
            know about the individual widgets in the user interface.
        \o  The subclass can be used to create multiple custom widgets in the
            same application or library, and the code for the subclass can be
            reused in other projects.
    \endlist

    Since Qt does not provided a specific address book widget, you subclass a
    standard Qt widget class and add features to it. The \c AddressBook class
    you create in this tutorial can be reused in situations where a basic
    address book is needed.

    \example examples/addressbook-sdk/part2
    \title Address Book 2 - Adding Addresses

    The next step to creating our basic address book application is to allow a
    little bit of user interaction.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part2-add-contact.png

    You will provide a push button that the user can click to add a new
    contact. Also, some form of data structure is needed to store these
    contacts in an organized way.


    \section1 Placing Widgets on The Form

    You can continue with the form from the last chapter; you have the
    labels and input fields set up, but you need to add push buttons to
    complete the process of adding a contact. Break the existing layouts by
    following the steps below:
    \list
        \o Select, \gui{Break Layout} from the context menu. You might have to
           do a \gui{Select All} with \key{Ctrl+A} first..
        \o Add three push buttons and double-click on each of them to set
           their text to "Add", "Submit", and "Cancel".
        \o Set the \c objectName of the buttons to \c addButton,
           \c submitButton and \c cancelButton respectively.
        \o A \gui{Vertical Spacer} is required to ensure that the push buttons
           will be laid out neatly; drag one from the \gui{Widget Box}.
        \o Lay out these three push buttons and the spacer vertically, by
           selecting all three of them using \key{Ctrl + click} and selecting
           \gui{Lay out Vertically} from the context menu. Alternatively you
           can  use the \key{Ctrl+L} shortcut key.

           \note Use the spacer as you do not want the buttons to be evenly
           spaced, but arranged closer to the top of the widget.
        \o The figure below shows the difference between using the spacer and
           not using it.
           \image addressbook-tutorial-part2-stretch-effects.png
        \o Select all the objects on the form using, \key{Ctrl+A} and lay them
           out in a grid.
        \o Lastly, set the top level widget's layout by right-clicking anywhere
           on the widget and selecting \gui{Lay out Horizontally} or
           \gui{Lay out Vertically}.
    \endlist

    The final design of the form is shown in the screenshot below:

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part2-form-design.png


    \section1 The AddressBook Class

    To ensure that the Address Book reacts to user interaction, you need to
    write slots for each push button that you added earlier. A slot is a
    function that responds to a particular signal. This concept will be
    discussed further in detail below. However, for an overview of Qt's signals
    and slots concept, you can refer to the \l{Signals and Slots} document.

    In the \l{examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.h}{\c addressbook.h}
    file, add the following code:

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.h slot definition

    Since the \c AddressBook class is a subclass of QWidget, Qt Creator
    includes QWidget in the header file.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.h include

    You need a container to store our address book contacts, so that you can
    traverse and display them. A QMap object, \c contacts, is used for this
    purpose as it holds a key-value pair: the contact's name as the \e key, and
    the contact's address as the \e value.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.h members

    You also declare two private QString objects, \c oldName and \c oldAddress.
    These objects are needed to hold the name and address of the contact that
    was last displayed, before you click \gui Add. So, when you
    click \gui Cancel, you can revert to displaying the details of the last
    contact.



    Let's move on to implementing the slots defined earlier. Within the
    constructor of \c AddressBook, you set up our fields by ensuring that
    \c nameLine and \c addressText are read-only, so that you can only display
    but not edit existing contact details.

    \note In order to prevent crashes, you need make sure that the
    autogenerated \c setupUi() call is always first in the constructor.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.cpp setup fields

    You also hide both \c submitButton and \c cancelButton as they will only be
    displayed when you click \gui Add, and this is handled by the
    \c addContact() function discussed below.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.cpp signal slot

    You connect the push buttons' \l{QAbstractButton::}{clicked()} signal to
    their respective slots. The figure below illustrates this.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part2-signals-and-slots.png

    Finally, set the window title to "Simple Address Book" using the
    \l{QWidget::}{setWindowTitle()} function. The tr() method allows us
    to translate user interface strings.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.cpp window title

    \section2 The \c addContact() Function

    In this function, begin by storing the last displayed contact details
    in \c oldName and \c oldAddress. Then clear these input fields and turn
    off the read-only mode. The focus is set on \c nameLine and display
    \c submitButton and \c cancelButton; but disable \c addButton.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.cpp addContact

    \section2 The \c submitContact() Function

    This function can be divided into three parts:

    \list 1
        \o  Extract the contact's detail from \c nameLine and \c addressText
            and store them in QString objects. Also validate to ensure that
            you did not click \gui Submit with empty input fields;
            otherwise, a QMessageBox is displayed to remind you for a name
            and address.

            \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.cpp submitContact part1

        \o  Then proceed to check if the contact already exists. If it does
            not exist, add the contact to \c contacts and display a
            QMessageBox to inform you about this, preventing you from
            adding duplicate contacts. Our \c contacts object is based on
            key-value pairs or name and address, hence, you want to ensure that
            \e key is unique.

            \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.cpp submitContact part2

        \o  Once you have handled both cases mentioned above, restore the
            push buttons to their normal state with the following code:

            \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.cpp submitContact part3
    \endlist

    The screenshot below shows the QMessageBox object used to display
    information messages to the user.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part2-add-successful.png

    \section2 The \c cancel() Function

    This function restores the last displayed contact details and enables
    \c addButton, as well as hides \c submitButton and \c cancelButton.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part2/addressbook.cpp cancel

    The general idea behind adding a contact is to give you the
    flexibility to click \gui Submit or \gui Cancel at any time. The flowchart
    below further explains this concept:

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part2-add-flowchart.png


    \section1 Running the Application

    Run your application now. You will be able to add as many unique contacts
    as you like.

    \title Address Book 3 - Navigating between Entries

    The address book application is now half complete. You need to add some
    functions to navigate between contacts. But first, you have to decide what
    sort of a data structure you would like to use to hold these contacts.

    In Chapter 2, you used a QMap of key-value pairs with the contact's name as
    the \e key, and the contact's address as the \e value. This works well for
    your case. However, in order to navigate and display each entry, a little
    bit of enhancement is needed.

    Enhance the QMap by making it replicate a data structure similar to a
    circularly-linked list, where all elements are connected, including the
    first element and the last element. The figure below illustrates this data
    structure.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part3-linkedlist.png


    \section1 Placing Widgets on The Form

    So far, your application allows us to add new contacts. However, you also
    need to traverse the existing contacts. To do so follow the steps
    mentioned below:
    \list
        \o Add two push buttons at the bottom of your application and name
           them: \gui Next and \gui Previous.
        \o The buttons' \c objectName should be \c nextButton and
           \c previousButton, respectively.
        \o Break your top level layout by right-clicking on \c AddressBook in
           the \gui{Object Inspector} and then select \gui{Lay out|Break Layout}.
        \o Place the \gui Next and \gui Previous buttons in a horizontal
           layout.
        \o Drag and drop the buttons together with their layout into the
           existing grid layout.
        \o Set a top level layout for the widget again.
    \endlist

    The screenshot below illustrates what you will see as the button layout
    approaches the grid layout; drop it then.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part3-drop-in-gridlayout.png

    \note Follow basic conventions for \c next() and \c previous() functions
    by placing the \c nextButton on the right and the \c previousButton on the
    left.


    \section1 The AddressBook Class

    In order to add navigation functions to the address book application,
    you need to add two more slots to our \c AddressBook class: \c next() and
    \c previous().

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part3/addressbook.h slot definition

    In the \c AddressBook constructor, you setup your fields and disable them
    by default. This is because navigation is only enabled when there is more
    than one contact in the address book.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part3/addressbook.cpp setup fields

    Next, connect the buttons to their respective slots:

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part3/addressbook.cpp signal slot

    The screenshot below is your expected graphical user interface. Notice that
    it is getting closer to your final application.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part3-screenshot.png

    Within your \c addContact() function, you have to disable the \gui Next and
    \gui Previous buttons so that you do not attempt to navigate while
    adding a contact.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part3/addressbook.cpp disable navigation

    Also, in your \c submitContact() function, enable the navigation buttons,
    depending on the size of \c contacts. As mentioned earlier, navigation is
    only enabled when there is more than one contact in the address book. The
    following lines of code demonstrates how to do this:

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part3/addressbook.cpp enable navigation

    Also include these lines of code in the \c cancel() function.

    Recall that you intend to emulate a circularly-linked list with your QMap
    object, \c contacts. So in the \c next() function, obtain an iterator
    for \c contacts and then:

    \list
        \o If the iterator is not at the end of \c contacts, increment it by
           one.
        \o If the iterator is at the end of \c contacts, move it to the
           beginning of \c contacts. This gives an illusion that our QMap
           is working like a circularly-linked list.
    \endlist

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part3/addressbook.cpp next

    Once you have iterated to the current object in \c contacts, display its
    contents on \c nameLine and \c addressText.

    Similarly, for the \c previous() function, obtain an iterator for
    \c contacts and then:

    \list
        \o  If the iterator is at the end of \c contacts, clear the display
            and return.
        \o  If the iterator is at the beginning of \c contacts, move it to
            the end.
        \o  Then decrement the iterator by one.
    \endlist

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part3/addressbook.cpp previous

    Again, display the contents of the current object in \c contacts.

    \title Address Book 4 - Editing and Removing Addresses

    This chapter looks at ways to modify the contents of contacts stored
    in the address book application.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part4-screenshot.png

    You now have an address book that not only holds contacts in an organized
    manner, but also allows navigation. It would be convenient to include edit
    and remove functions so that a contact's details can be changed when
    needed. However, this requires a little improvement, in the form of enums.

    In our previous chapters, you had two modes: \c AddingMode and
    \c NavigationMode - but they were not defined as enums. Instead, you
    enabled and disabled the corresponding buttons manually, resulting in
    multiple lines of repeated code.

    In this chapter, define the \c Mode enum with three different values:
    \list
        \o \c{NavigationMode}
        \o \c{AddingMode}
        \o \c{EditingMode}
    \endlist

    \section1 Placing Widgets on The Form

    To edit and remove contacts, you need two push buttons. Drag them and name
    them accordingly. Their \c objectName properties should be \c editButton
    and \c removeButton, respectively. The quickest way to place these two
    buttons into our existing layout, is to simply drag and drop them. Use the
    screenshot below as a guide:

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part4-drop-in-gridlayout.png


    \section1 The AddressBook Class

    Update the header file to contain the \c Mode enum:

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.h enum

    Also add two new slots, \c editContact() and \c removeContact(), to your
    current list of public slots.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.h slot definition

    In order to switch between modes, introduce the \c updateInterface()
    function to control the enabling and disabling of all push buttons.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.h updateInterface

    Lastly, declare \c currentMode to keep track of the enum's current mode.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.h current mode

    Let's begin by implementing the mode-changing features of the address book
    application. The \c editButton and \c removeButton are disabled by default,
    as the address book starts up with zero contacts in memory.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp extract objects

    These buttons are then connected to their respective slots,
    \c editContact() and \c removeContact.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp signal slot

    Now look at the \c editContact() and \c removeContact() functions in
    detail.

    \section2 The \c editContact() Function

    This function stores the contact's old details in \c oldName and
    \c oldAddress, before switching the mode to \c EditingMode. In this mode,
    the \c submitButton and \c cancelButton are both enabled. Hence, the user
    can change the contact's details and click either button.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp editContact

    Since you will reuse the \c submitButton for both: adding a new contact and
    editing an existing contact, you need to modify our existing
    \c submitContact() function. So, divide it in two with an \c{if-else}
    statement.

    First, check \c currentMode to see if it is in \c AddingMode. If it is,
    proceed with your adding process.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp submitContact part1
    \dots
    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp submitContact part2

    Otherwise, check to see if \c currentMode is in \c EditingMode. If it
    is, compare \c oldName with \c name. If the name has changed, remove
    the old contact from \c contacts and insert the newly updated contact.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp submitContact part3

    If only the contact's address has changed, that is the \c oldAddress is
    not the  same as \c address, update the contact's address. Lastly, set
    \c currentMode to \c NavigationMode. This is an important step as it
    re-enables all the disabled push buttons.

    To remove a contact from the address book, implement the
    \c removeContact() function.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp removeContact

    This function first checks to see if the contact exists in \c contacts. If
    it does, display a QMessageBox, to confirm the removal with the user.
    Once the user has confirmed, call \c previous() to ensure that the
    user interface shows another contact, and remove the contact using
    \l{QMap}'s \l{QMap::}{remove()} function. As a courtesy, display a
    QMessageBox to inform the user. Both the message boxes used in this
    function are shown below:

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part4-confirm.png
    \image addressbook-tutorial-part4-remove.png

    \section2 The \c updateInterface() Function

    This function is mentioned earlier as a means to enable and disable the
    push buttons, depending on the current mode. The function updates the
    current mode according to the \c mode argument passed to it, assigning it
    to \c currentMode, before checking its value.

    Each of the push buttons is then enabled or disabled, depending on the
    current mode. The code for \c AddingMode and \c EditingMode is shown below:

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp updateInterface part1

    For \c NavigationMode, however, include conditions within the parameters
    of the QPushButton::setEnabled() function. This is to ensure that
    \c editButton and \c removeButton are enabled when there is at least one
    contact in the address book; \c nextButton and \c previousButton are only
    enabled when there is more than one contact in the address book.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp updateInterface part2

    By performing the task of setting the mode and updating the user interface
    in the same function, you avoid the possibility of the user interface
    getting "out of sync" with the internal state of the application.

    To maintain consistency, you need to modify our \c addContact() and
    \c cancel() functions respectively. Below is the code:

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp addContact
    \dots
    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part4/addressbook.cpp cancel

    \title Address Book 5 - Adding a Find Function

    This chapter looks at ways to locate contacts and addresses in the
    address book application.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part5-screenshot.png

    As you keep adding contacts to your address book, it becomes tedious to
    navigate them with the \gui Next and \gui Previous buttons. In this case,
    a \gui Find function would be more efficient in looking up contacts. The
    screenshot above shows the \gui Find button and its position on the panel
    of buttons.

    When you click on the \gui Find button, it is useful to display a
    dialog prompting the user for a contact's name. Qt provides QDialog, which
    you subclass in this chapter, to implement a FindDialog class.


    \section1 Designing The FindDialog

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part5-finddialog-in-designer.png

    Begin by adding a new \c{.ui} file and a corresponding class to our
    project. Right click on your project and select
    \gui{Add New...} > \gui{Qt} > \gui{Qt Designer Form Class}.
    In the \gui{Qt Designer Form Class} dialog, select
    \e{Dialog without buttons}. Name the class \c{FindDialog} and add the files
    it to your project. Open your new form in the \QD form editor within
    Qt Creator by double-clicking on the \c{finddialog.ui} file in
    the \gui{Project Sidebar}.

    To replicate the screenshot above, you need a label, a line edit, and a push
    button. Drag these onto your form. Set their text accordingly and name them
    \c label, \c lineEdit, and \c findButton, respectively. Place these widgets
    in a horizontal layout. Then set a top level layout - either horizontal or
    vertical.


    \section1 Implementing The FindDialog Class

    Let's look at \c{FindDialog}'s header file. Define a public function,
    \c findText(), to be used by classes that instantiate \c FindDialog. This
    function allows the classes to obtain the search string entered by
    you. A public slot, \c findClicked(), is also defined to handle the
    search string when you click the \gui Find button.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/finddialog.h findText
    \dots
    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/finddialog.h findClicked

    Now, lets look at our constructor in the \c{finddialog.cpp} file.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/finddialog.cpp constructor

    In \c findClicked(), validate to ensure that you did not click the
    \gui Find button without entering a contact's name. Then, set
    \c findText to the search string, extracted from \c lineEdit. After that,
    clear the contents of \c lineEdit and hide the dialog.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/finddialog.cpp findClicked

    \c findText() is public, which makes it easy for classes instantiating
    and using \c FindDialog to access the search string that you have entered
    and accepted.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/finddialog.cpp findText

    Finally, connect your signals to their respective slots. Notice that
    \c{findButton}'s \l{QPushButton::}{clicked()} signal is connected to
    \c findClicked(), which calls \l{QDialog::}{accept()} or
    \l{QDialog::}{reject()}. The \l{QDialog::}{accept()} slot provided by
    QDialog hides the dialog and sets the result code to
    \l{QDialog::}{Accepted}, while \l{QDialog::}{reject()}
    sets it to \l{QDialog::}{Rejected} accordingly. Use this function to help
    \c{AddressBook}'s \c findContact() function know when the \c FindDialog
    object has been closed. This logic will be explained in further detail
    when discussing the \c findContact() function.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part5-signals-and-slots.png


    \section1 The AddressBook Class

    To ensure that you can use \c FindDialog from within your \c AddressBook
    class, include \c finddialog.h in the \c addressbook.h file.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/addressbook.h include

    So far, all your address book features have a QPushButton and a
    corresponding slot. Similarly, the \gui Find feature, has
    \c{ui->findButton} and \c findContact().

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/addressbook.h slot definition

    Once you have instantiated a dialog, you might want to use it more than
    once; using a private variable allows you to refer to it from more than one
    place in the class.

    Within the \c AddressBook class's constructor, connect the
    \c{findButton}'s \l{QPushButton::}{clicked()} signal to \c findContact().

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/addressbook.cpp signal slot

    Now, all that is left is the code for our \c findContact() function:

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/addressbook.cpp findContact

    Start out by displaying the \c FindDialog instance, \c dialog. This is
    when you enter a contact name to look up. Once you click the
    dialog's \c findButton, the dialog is hidden and the result code is set to
    either QDialog::Accepted or QDialog::Rejected by the FindDialog's
    \c findClicked() method. This ensures that you only search for a contact
    if you have typed something in the FindDialog's line edit.

    Then proceed to extract the search string, which in this case is
    \c contactName, using \c{FindDialog}'s \c findText() function. If the
    contact exists in our address book, display it immediately. Otherwise,
    display the QMessageBox shown below to indicate that their search
    failed.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part5-dialogbox.png

    The concept behind finding a contact only applies for cases where you have
    more than two contacts in our address book. Hence, implement this
    behavior by modifying our \c{Navigation Mode} within your
    \c updateInterface() function, by only enabling the \gui Find button when
    you have more than two contacts.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part5/addressbook.cpp enable

    \title Address Book 6 - Loading and Saving

    This chapter covers the file handling features of Qt that is used to write
    loading and saving routines for the address book application.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part6-screenshot.png

    Although browsing and searching for contacts are useful features, your
    address book is not really ready for use until you can save existing
    contacts and load them again at a later time. Qt provides a number of
    classes for \l{Input/Output and Networking}{input and output}, but you have
    chosen to use two which are simple to use in combination: QFile and
    QDataStream.

    A QFile object represents a file on disk that can be read from and written
    to. QFile is a subclass of the more general QIODevice class which represents
    many different kinds of devices.

    A QDataStream object is used to serialize binary data so that it can be
    stored in a QIODevice and retrieved again later. Reading from a QIODevice
    and writing to it is as simple as opening the stream - with the respective
    device as a parameter - and reading from or writing to it.


    \section1 Placing Widgets on The Form

    To load and save files containing contact details, you need two push
    buttons. Drag them and name them accordingly. Their \c objectName
    properties should be \c loadButton and \c saveButton, respectively. Then,
    similar to \l{Address Book 5 - Adding a Find Function}{Chapter 5}, place
    these buttons in our layout simply by dragging and dropping them.

    The \c text property of our push buttons are \gui{Load...} and
    \gui{Save...} respectively. Ideally, it would be more user-friendly to set
    the push buttons' labels to \gui{Load contacts from file} and
    \gui{Save contacts to file}. However, due to the size of our push buttons,
    set the labels to \gui{Load...} and \gui{Save...} instead.

    Fortunately, Qt Creator's \QD plugin provides a simple way to set tooltips
    with the \c toolTip property. So, set your buttons' tooltips to
    \gui{Load contacts from file} and \gui{Save contacts to file} respectively.
    To test your tooltip, use \key{Alt+Shift+R} and hover your mouse cursor on
    the push buttons.


    \image addressbook-tutorial-part6-propertyeditor.png


    \section1 The AddressBook Class

    Declare two public slots, \c saveToFile() and \c loadFromFile().

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part6/addressbook.h slot definition

    Now lets look at the \c saveToFile() and \c loadFromFile() functions in
    detail.


    \section2 The \c saveToFile() Function

    To save a contact, first obtain \c fileName using
    QFileDialog::getSaveFileName(). This is a convenience function provided by
    QFileDialog, which pops up a modal file dialog and allows you to enter
    a file name or select any existing \c{.abk} file. The \c{.abk} file is our
    Address Book extension that you create when you save contacts.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part6/addressbook.cpp saveToFile part1

    The file dialog that pops up is displayed in the screenshot below:

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part6-savedialog.png

    If \c fileName is not empty, create a QFile object, \c file, with
    \c fileName. The QFile object works with QDataStream as QFile is a
    QIODevice.

    Next, attempt to open the file in \l{QIODevice::}{WriteOnly} mode. If
    this is unsuccessful, display a QMessageBox to inform the user.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part6/addressbook.cpp saveToFile part2

    Otherwise, instantiate a QDataStream object, \c out, to write the open
    file. QDataStream requires that the same version of the stream is used for
    reading and writing. Ensure that this is the case by setting the version
    used to the version introduced with Qt 4.5 before serializing the data into
    \c file.
    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part6/addressbook.cpp saveToFile part3


    \section2 The \c loadFromFile() Function

    To load a contact, also obtain \c fileName using
    QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(). This function, the counterpart to
    QFileDialog::getSaveFileName(), also pops up the modal file dialog and
    allows you to enter a file name or select any existing \c{.abk} file
    to load it into the address book.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part6/addressbook.cpp loadFromFile part1

    On Windows, for example, this function pops up a native file dialog, as
    shown in the following screenshot.

    \image addressbook-tutorial-part6-opendialog.png

    If \c fileName is not empty, again, use a QFile object, \c file, and
    attempt to open it in \l{QIODevice::}{ReadOnly} mode. Similar to your
    implementation of \c saveToFile(), if this attempt is unsuccessful,
    display a QMessageBox to inform the user.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part6/addressbook.cpp loadFromFile part2

    Otherwise, instantiate a QDataStream object, \c in, set its version as
    above and read the serialized data into hte \c contacts data structure. The
    \c contacts object is emptied before data is read into it to simplify the
    file reading process. A more advanced method would be to read the contacts
    into a temporary QMap object, and copy over non-duplicate contacts into
    \c contacts.

    \snippet examples/addressbook-sdk/part6/addressbook.cpp loadFromFile part3

    To display the contacts that have been read from the file, you must first
    validate the data obtained to ensure that the file you read from actually
    contains address book contacts. If it does, display the first contact;
    otherwise, display a QMessageBox to inform you about the problem.
    Lastly, connect the \c clicked() signal of the push buttons
    with the \c loadFromFile() and \c saveToFile():

    Although your address book application is useful in its own right, it would
    be useful if you could exchange contact data with other applications. The
    vCard format is a popular file format that can be used for this purpose. In
    this chapter, you extend our address book client to allow contacts to be
    exported to vCard \c{.vcf} files.

    \section1 Placing Widgets on The Form

    Add a push button into our layout by dragging and dropping it in, with
    \c exportButton as its \c objectName. The \c toolTip property is set to
    \gui{Export as vCard}.

    Declare a public slot, \c exportAsVCard(), in your header file.

    Within the \c AddressBook constructor, connect \c{exportButton}'s
    \l{QPushButton::}{clicked()} signal to \c exportAsVCard().
