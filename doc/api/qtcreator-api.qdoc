    \title Qt Creator

    Qt Creator is Nokia's crossplatform IDE. The core of Qt Creator is
    basically only a \l{ExtensionSystem}{plugin loader}.
    All functionality is implemented in plugins, the basis of Qt Creator is
    implemented in the \l{Core} {Core} Plugin. The plugin manager provides
    simple means for plugin cooperation that allow plugins to provide
    hooks for other plugin's extensions.

    To get an overview of what parts of Qt Creator are extensible, have a look at the \l{Common Extension Tasks} page.
    Also read and follow the Qt Creator \l{Qt Creator Coding Rules}{coding style and best practice patterns}.

    \section1 Libraries

    \section2 Core Libraries

    There are a few core libraries used by many parts of Qt Creator.

    \table
    \header
    \o Library Name
    \o Description

    \row
    \o \l{Aggregation}
    \o Adds functionality for "glueing" QObjects of different
    types together, so you can "cast" between them.

    \row
    \o \l{ExtensionSystem}
    \o Implements the plugin loader framework. Provides a base class for plugins and

    \o \l{qtcreatorcdbext}
    \o Windows CDB debugger extension

    \endtable

    \section1 Plugins

    As already mentioned, Qt Creator is basically only a plugin loader framework
    which gets its IDE functionality through plugins. The most important plugin
    is the Core plugin which provides all the basic functionality needed
    later to integrate e.g. editors or mode windows.

    \table
    \header
    \o Plugin Name
    \o Description

    \row
    \o \l{Core}
    \o The core plugin. Provides the main window and managers for editors,
    actions, mode windows and files, just to mention the most important ones.

    \o \l{Find}
    \o Support for searching text in arbitrary widgets, and arbitrary other things.

    \row
    \o \l{Locator}
    \o Hooks for providing content for Locator.
