    \title Creating Screens

    You can use predefined QML elements and your own components to create
    screens. Typically, the main qml file in a Qt Quick project specifies the
    main window of an application.

    \if defined(qcmanual)
    The QML files in the project folder are displayed in \gui {QML Components}
    in the \gui Library pane.
    \endif

    You can also use ready-made Qt Quick Components that allow you to create
    screens with a native look and feel for a particular target platform. You
    can install the components as part of \QSDK.

    \if defined(qcmanual)
    \section1 Adding Components to Screens

    \list 1

        \o  Drag and drop components from the \gui Library pane to the editor.

        \o  Select components in the \gui Navigator pane to edit their
            properties in the \gui Properties pane.

            For example, you can anchor components to a position on the screen.

    \endlist
    \endif


    \section1 Using Data Models

    You can create the following types of views to organize items provided by
    \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qdeclarativemodels.html}{data models}:

    \list

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-gridview.html}{Grid View}
            provides a grid vizualization of a model.

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-listview.html}{List View}
            provides a list vizualization of a model.

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-pathview.html}{Path View}
            visualizes the contents of a model along a path.

    \endlist

    When you add a Grid View, List View, or Path View element, the
    \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-listmodel.html}{ListModel} and the
    delegate component that creates an instance for each item in the model are
    added automatically. You can edit element properties
    \if defined(qcmanual)
    in the \gui Properties pane or
    \endif
    in the code editor. You can also replace the default model and
    delegate with other, more complex models and delegates in the code editor.

    \section1 Positioning Items on Screens

    You can use the following items to arrange items on screens:

    \list

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qml-column.html}{Column}
            arranges its child items vertically.

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qml-row.html}{Row}
            arranges its child items horizontally.

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qml-grid.html}{Grid}
            arranges its child items so that they are aligned in a grid and
            are not overlapping.

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qml-flow.html}{Flow}
            arranges its child items side by side, wrapping as necessary.

    \endlist

    \if defined(qcmanual)
    To lay out several items in a Column, Row, Grid, or Flow element, select
    the elements on the canvas, and then select \gui Layout in the context
    menu.
    \endif


    \section1 Using States

    Use states and transitions to navigate between screens.

    QML states typically describe user interface configurations, such as the UI
    elements, their properties and behavior and the available actions. For
    example, you can use states to create two screens.

    \if defined(qcmanual)
    To add states, click the empty slot in the \gui States pane. Then modify the
    new state in the visual editor.

    \image qmldesigner-states.png "States pane"

    The properties that you change in a state are highlighted with blue color.
    In the code editor, you can see the changes recorded as changes to the base
    state.
    \endif


    To keep the QML code clean, you should create a base state that contains all
    the elements you will need in the application. You can then create states,
    in which you hide and show a set of items and modify their properties.
    This allows you to:

    \list

        \o  Align items on different screens with each other.

        \o  Avoid excessive property changes. If an item is invisible in the
            base state, you must define all changes to its child elements as
            property changes, which leads to complicated QML code.

        \o  Minimize the differences between the base state and the other states
            to keep the QML code short and readable and to improve performance.

        \o  Avoid problems when using transitions and animation when changing
            states.

    \endlist

    \if defined(qcmanual)
    To create screens for an application by using states:

    \list 1

        \o  In the base state, add all elements you will need in the application.
            While you work on one screen, you can click the
            \inlineimage qmldesigner-show-hide-icon.png
            icon to hide elements on the canvas that are not part of a screen.

        \o  In the \gui States pane, click the empty slot to create a new state
            and give it a name. For example, \c Normal.

        \o  In the \gui Properties pane, deselect the \gui Visibility check box
            or set \gui Opacity to 0 for each element that is not needed in this
            view. If you specify the setting for the parent element, all child
            elements inherit it and are also hidden.

            \image qmldesigner-screen-design.png "Designing screens"

        \o  Create additional states for each screen and set the visibility
            or opacity of the elements in the screen.

        \o  To determine which view opens when the application starts, use the
            code editor to set the state of the root item of the .qml file, as
            specified by the following code snippet:

            \qml
            Item {
                state: "Normal"
            }
            \endqml

        \endlist
    \endif

    \title Animating Screens

    To make movement between states smooth, you can specify transitions. You can
    use different types of animated transitions. For example, you can animate
    changes to property values and colors. You can use rotation animation to
    control the direction of rotation. For more information, see
    \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qdeclarativeanimation.html}{QML Animation}.

    You can use the \c ParallelAnimation element to start several animations at
    the same time. Or use the \c SequentialAnimation element to run them one
    after another.

    You can use the code editor to specify transitions. For more information,
    see \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-transition.html}
    {QML Transition Element}.

    \title Adding User Interaction Methods

    You can add the following basic interaction methods to scenes:

    \list

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-flickable.html}{Flickable}
            items can be flicked horizontally or vertically.

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-flipable.html}{Flipable}
            items can be flipped between their front and back sides by using
            rotation, state, and transition.

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-focusscope.html}{Focus Scope}
            assists in keyboard focus handling when building reusable QML
            components.

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-mousearea.html}{Mouse Area}
            enables simple mouse handling.

    \endlist
