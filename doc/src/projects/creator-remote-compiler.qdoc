    \title Building with Remote Compiler

    The \gui {Remote Compiler} target is an interface to a compilation service
    at Nokia Developer. It provides a simple, standardized environment for
    building Qt applications and creating installation packages for mobile
    device targets when you do not have the necessary tool chains and SDKs
    installed or they are not supported on the development PC. You can choose
    from a set of supported devices.

    You need a Nokia Developer user account to use the Remote Compiler. You can
    create an account for free at \l{http://www.developer.nokia.com/}
    {Nokia Developer}.

    \note Remote Compiler is an experimental component that is installed as
    part of \QSDK.
