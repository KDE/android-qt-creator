    \title Running on Multiple Targets

    By default, running an application also builds it and deploys it to a
    location from where it can be run on the desktop, in Qt Simulator, or
    on a mobile device that is connected to the development PC.

    To run executable files without deploying them first, deselect the
    \gui {Tools > Options > Project > Always deploy project before running it}
    option. This allows you to test SIS files that you receive from Nokia
    Publish or Symbian Signed after you have them signed, for example.

    For more information on the options you have, see
    \l{Specifying Run Settings}.
