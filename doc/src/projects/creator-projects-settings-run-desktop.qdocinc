    \section2 Specifying Run Settings for Desktop Targets

    You can specify command line arguments to be passed to the executable
    and the working directory to use. The working directory defaults to
    the directory of the build result.

    For console applications, check the \gui{Run in Terminal} check box.
    If you need to run with special environment variables set up, you
    also do it in the run configuration settings.

    You can also create custom executable run configurations where you
    can set the executable to be run. For more information, see
    \l{Specifying a Custom Executable to Run}.
