    \title Building and Running

    \image creator_buildingrunning.png

    \QC provides support for building, running, and deploying Qt applications
    for different \l{glossary-development-target}{targets}.

    \list
        \o  \l{Building for Multiple Targets}

            \e {Build configurations} contain everything you need to compile
            the sources into binaries.

        \o  \l{Running on Multiple Targets}

            \e {Run configurations} start the application in the location
            where it was copied by the \e{deploy configuration}. By default,
            when you select the \gui Run function, \QC builds the project,
            deploys it to the selected target, and runs it there. However,
            if you have not made any changes to the project since you last
            built and deployed it, \QC simply runs it again.

        \o  \l{Deploying to Mobile Devices}

            \e {Deploy configurations} handle the packaging and copying of
            the necessary files to a location you want to run the executable
            at. The files can be copied to a location in the file system of
            the development PC or a mobile device.

        \o  \l{Connecting Mobile Targets}

            When you install tool chains for build targets as part of the \QSDK,
            the build and run settings for mobile device targets are set up
            automatically. However, you might need to install and configure some
            additional software on the devices to be able to connect to them
            from the development PC.

        \o  \l{Customizing the Build Process}

            By default, running an application also builds it and deploys it to
            a location from where it can be run on the target. You can change
            the relationship between the build, run, and deploy configurations.

        \o  \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtsimulator/index.html}
            {Using Qt Simulator}

            You can use the Qt Simulator to test Qt applications that are
            intended for mobile devices in an environment similar to that of
            the device. You can change the information that the device has
            about its configuration and environment.
            Qt Simulator does not support any device specific APIs by design.
            Therefore, applications that run well on Qt Simulator also run on
            any device that hosts the Qt and Qt Mobility libraries.
            The Qt Simulator is installed as part of the \QSDK. After it is
            installed, you can select it as a build target in \QC.

        \o  \l{Using Maemo or MeeGo Harmattan Emulator}

            You cannot use Qt Simulator to test applications that use device
            specific libraries, such as native device APIs. To test such
            applications, use the device emulators or real devices. With the
            emulators, you can test how your application reacts to hardware
            controls, such as the power button, and to the touch screen.
            Usually, it is faster to test on a real device connected to the
            development PC than to use the emulators. The emulator is installed
            as part of the \QSDK.

        \o  \l{Building with Remote Compiler}

            You can use a compilation service at Nokia Developer to build Qt
            applications and create installation packages for mobile device
            targets when you do not have the necessary tool chains and SDKs
            installed or they are not supported on the development PC. You can
            choose from a set of supported devices. You can install the Remote
            Compiler target as part of the \QSDK.
