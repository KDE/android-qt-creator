    \title Opening Projects

    \QC stores information that it needs to build projects in a .user file. If
    \QC cannot find the file when you open an existing project, it prompts you
    to enter the information. If you created the project by using another \QC
    instance, \QC asks whether you want to use the old settings. The settings
    are specific to the development environment, and should not be copied from
    one environment to another. Therefore, we recommend that you click \gui No
    and enter the information again in the \gui {Project Setup} dialog.

    The \gui {Project Setup} dialog displays a list of development environments
    for target platforms that are installed on the development PC. Select the Qt
    versions that you want to use to build the project for each target.

    If \QC cannot find an existing build for a particular development
    environment (Qt version) and target, it starts out from a clean slate, and
    creates a new build in the specified directory. \QC suggests a name
    and location for the directory that you can change.

    By default, \QC does a \l{glossary-shadow-build}{shadow build} and also
    creates the directory. However, shadow building is not supported for the
    following targets on Windows:

    \list

        \o  Maemo5

        \o  MeeGo Harmattan

        \if defined(qcmanual)
        \o  Symbian Devices
        \endif

    \endlist

    If you have built the project before, \QC can use the existing build
    configuration to make the exact same build as found in the directory
    available to \QC.

    If you know you have a build, but it is not listed, click \gui {Add Build}
    to locate it. Select a directory, and \QC scans it (including
    subdirectories) for additional builds of the project. \QC adds the found
    builds to the target list.

    You can edit the build configuration later. For more information, see
    \l{Editing Build Configurations}.

    To open a project:

    \list 1

        \o  Select \gui File > \gui{Open File or Project} and select the project
            to open.

        \o  In the \gui {Project Setup} dialog, select the Qt versions to use as
            build targets for your project, and click \gui{Finish}.

            \note If you have only one development environment installed, this
            dialog is skipped.

    \endlist

    \QC parses all the source files in the project and performs a semantic
    analysis to build up the information that it needs for functions such as
    navigation and finding usages. A progress bar is displayed during parsing.
