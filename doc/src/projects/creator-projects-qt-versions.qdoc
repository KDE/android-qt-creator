    \title Adding Qt Versions

    \QC allows you to have multiple versions of Qt installed on your development
    PC and use different versions to build your projects for different targets.
    For example, \QSDK contains special Qt versions for developing applications
    for mobile devices.

    \QC checks the directories listed in the \c{PATH} environment
    variable for the qmake executable. If a qmake executable is found, it is
    referred to as \bold{Qt in PATH} and selected as the Qt version to use
    in the \gui Projects mode in the \gui {Build Settings}. If \QC
    cannot find qmake, the value in the \gui {Qt version} field might be
    invalid and you might need to change it.

    \QC automatically detects the Qt versions that are registered by
    your system or by \QSDK. To view the settings for each Qt version, move the
    mouse pointer over it in the list. To add Qt versions, select
    \gui {Tools > Options > Build & Run > Qt Versions}.

    Typically, you select the Qt versions for a project when you use project
    wizards to create the project. You can add Qt versions for a project in
    \gui {Build Settings}.

    \section2 Setting Up New Qt Versions

    To add a Qt version:

        \list 1

            \o  Select \gui {Tools > Options > Build & Run > Qt Versions > Add}.

                \image qtcreator-qt4-qtversions-add.png

            \o  In the \gui{Version name} field, edit the name that \QC
                suggests for the Qt version.

            \o  In the \gui{qmake location} field, enter the path to the
                directory where the qmake executable is located.

                \QC automatically determines the path to the binaries in
                the Qt installation and displays it in the dialog.

            \o  In the \gui Helpers section, you can build the debugging
                helpers that are available for the Qt version. This is
                necessary, because the internal data structures of Qt can
                change between versions. For more information, see
                \l{Using Debugging Helpers}.
