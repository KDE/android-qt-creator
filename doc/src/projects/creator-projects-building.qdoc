    \title Building Applications for Multiple Targets

    You can build applications for multiple \l{glossary-development-target}
    {targets}. By default, when you run the application on a target, you
    automatically build it for the target and deploy it to the target first.
    However, you can also perform each operation separately.

    To check that the application code can be compiled and linked for a target,
    you can build the project. The build errors and warnings are displayed in
    the \gui {Issues} output pane. More detailed information is displayed
    in the \gui {Compile Output} pane.

    To build an application:

    \list 1

        \o Select a target for the project.

        \image qtcreator-target-selector.png "Target selector"

        \o Choose \gui {Build > Build Project} or press \key {Ctrl+B}.

    \endlist

    For more information on the options you have, see
    \l{Specifying Build Settings}.
