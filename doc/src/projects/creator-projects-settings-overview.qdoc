    \title Configuring Projects

    When you install the \QSDK, the build and run settings for the tool chains
    delivered with the \QSDK are set up automatically.

    To view and modify the settings for currently open projects, switch to the
    \gui Projects mode by pressing \key Ctrl+5.

    \image qtcreator-project-targets.png

    You can add a target if the development environment for the target platform
    is installed on the development PC and the Qt version is configured. Click
    \inlineimage qtcreator-qt4-addbutton.png "Add Target button"
    and select from a list of available targets. To remove a target, select it
    and click
    \inlineimage qtcreator-target-remove.png "Remove Target button"
    .

    You can select the targets and use the \gui Build menu commands to build,
    deploy, and run projects.

    The project pane consists of the following tabs:

    \list

        \o  \l{Running on Multiple Targets}{Targets}

            \list

                \o  \l{Specifying Build Settings}{Build Settings}

                \o  \l{Specifying Run Settings}{Run Settings}

            \endlist

                \note If you have installed the development environment for only
                    one target, the \gui Targets tab is replaced by a \gui Build
                    tab and a \gui Run tab.
                    If you have not configured the project for building, the
                    \gui Targets tab is replaced by the \l{Opening Projects}
                    {Configure Projects} tab.

        \o  \l{Specifying Editor Settings}{Editor Settings}

        \o  \l{Specifying Code Style Settings}{Code Style Settings}

        \o  \l{Specifying Dependencies}{Dependencies}

    \endlist

    Use the \gui Build and \gui Run buttons to switch between the build and
    run settings for the active project.

    If you have multiple projects open in \QC, use the tabs at the top of the
    window to navigate between their settings.
