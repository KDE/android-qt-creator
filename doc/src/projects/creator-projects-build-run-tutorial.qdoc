    \title Building and Running an Example Application

    You can test that your installation is successful by opening an existing
    example application project.

    \list 1

        \o  On the \gui Welcome page, select \gui {Demos and Examples},
            and then search for \gui {Toys: Clocks Example} in the
            list of examples.

            \image qtcreator-gs-build-example-open.png "Selecting an example"

        \o  Select \l{glossary-development-target}{targets} for the project.
            Select at least Qt Simulator
            and one of the mobile targets, Symbian Device, Maemo 5, or
            MeeGo Harmattan, depending on the device you develop for.

            \image qtcreator-gs-build-example-targets.png "Selecting targets"

            \note If you have only one target installed, this dialog is
            skipped. You can add installed targets later in the \gui Projects
            mode.

            \note The project opens in the \gui Edit mode, and the documentation
            for the example hides these instructions. To return to these
            instructions, select \gui {Previous Page} on the toolbar or
            press \key {Alt+Left}.

        \o  To test the application in Qt Simulator, click the \gui {Target
            Selector} and select \gui {Qt Simulator}.

            \image {qtcreator-gs-build-example-select-qs.png} "Selecting Qt Simulator as target"

        \o  Click
            \inlineimage{qtcreator-run.png}
            to build the application and run it in Qt Simulator.

        \o  To see the compilation progress, press \key{Alt+4} to open the
            \gui {Compile Output} pane.

            The \gui Build progress bar on the toolbar turns green when the
            project is successfully built. The application opens in
            Qt Simulator.

            \image {qt-simulator.png} "Qt Simulator"

        \o  Change the settings in the \gui Model view. For example, rotate the
            device by clicking the \gui {Orientation} buttons or choose from the
            various mobile device configurations in the \gui {Device} field. You
            can also simulate various mobile functions and create your own
            scripts.

        \if defined(qcmanual)
        \o  To test the application on a Symbian device, check that the required
            Qt libraries and a debugging agent are installed on the device. For
            more information, see \l{Connecting Symbian Devices}.

        \o  Click the \gui {Target Selector} and select \gui {Symbian Device}.

        \o  Click \gui Run to build the application and run it on the Symbian
            device.
        \endif
