    \title Using Other Build Systems

    \QC project wizards create projects that are configured to use qmake. Most
    of the instructions in this manual apply to using qmake.

    \list

        \o  \l{Setting Up a CMake Project}

            CMake is an alternative to qmake for automating the generation of
            build configurations.

        \o  \l{Setting Up an Autotools Project}

            \QC can open projects that use the Autotools build system. You can
            build and run the projects directly from \QC.

        \o  \l{Setting Up a Generic Project}

            \QC supports generic projects, so you can import existing projects
            that do not use qmake or CMake. This enables you to use \QC as a
            code editor and to fully control the steps and commands used to
            build the project.
