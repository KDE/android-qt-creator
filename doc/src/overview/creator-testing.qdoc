        \o  \l{Debugging}

            If you install \QC as part of \QSDK, the GNU Symbolic Debugger
            is installed automatically and you should be ready to start
            debugging after you create a new project. However, you can
            change the setup to use debugging tools for Windows, for
            example. You can connect mobile devices to your development PC
            and debug processes running on the devices.

        \o  \l{Analyzing Code}

            \QC integrates Valgrind code analysis tools for detecting memory
            leaks and profiling function execution. You must download and
            install them separately to use them from \QC. The QML Profiler is
            installed as part of \QC. It enables you to profile your Qt Quick
            applications.
