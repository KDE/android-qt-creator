                If you have not used an integrated development environment (IDE)
                before, or want to know what kind of IDE \QC is, go to
                \l{IDE Overview}.
            \o  \bold {\l{User Interface}}

                If you have not used \QC before, and want to become familiar
                with the parts of the user interface, go to \l{User Interface}.
            \o  \bold {\l{Building and Running an Example Application}}

                To check that \l{glossary-development-target}{targets} were
                successfully installed as part of the \QSDK installation, open
                an example application and run it. If you have not done so
                before, go to \l{Building and Running an Example Application}.
            \o  \bold {\l{Tutorials}}

                Now you are ready to start developing your own applications.
                Pick a tutorial to follow in \l{Tutorials}
