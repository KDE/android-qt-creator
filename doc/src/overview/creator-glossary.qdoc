                \target glossary-system-qt
            \o  This is the Qt
                version for the \c qmake command found in your \c PATH
                environment variable.
                This is likely to be the system's Qt version.

                \target glossary-project-qt
            \o  The version of Qt configured in the \gui{Projects} mode,
                \gui {Build Settings}, \gui {Qt Version} field. This is the Qt
                version that is actually used by a particular project.

                \target glossary-shadow-build
            \o  Shadow building means building a project in a separate
                directory, the \e{build directory}. The build directory is
                different from the source directory. One of the benefits of
                shadow building is that it keeps your source directory clean.
                Shadow building is the best practice if you need many build
                configurations for a single set of source.

                \endraw
                \target glossary-development-target
            \o  Target means the software platform for which you develop an
                application. Qt Creator groups platform specific settings (such
                as build configurations, compatible tool chains, and supported
                Qt versions) as targets to make cross-platform development
                easier.

                Component
                \endraw
                \target glossary-component
            \o  A component is an instantiable QML definition, typically
                contained in a .qml file. For instance, a Button component may
                be defined in Button.qml. The QML runtime may instantiate this
                Button component to create Button objects. Alternatively, a
                component may be defined inside a
                \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qmlreusablecomponents.html}
                {Component} element.
