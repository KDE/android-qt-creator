    \title Connecting Mobile Targets

    You can connect mobile devices to the development PC to build, run, debug,
    and analyze applications on them from \QC. When you install mobile targets
    as part of the \QSDK, the build and run settings for the target devices are
    set up automatically in \QC. Currently, the tool chain for building
    applications for generic Linux devices is not included in \QSDK.

    You can connect the device to the development PC using a USB connection.
    Additionally, you can connect Linux-based devices by using a WLAN
    connection.

    \list

        \o  \l{Connecting Generic Linux Devices}

            If you have the tool chain for building applications for generic
            Linux devices (with no MADDE support) installed on the development
            PC, you can add it to \QC. Create device configurations and select
            them in the \QC run settings.

       \o  \l{Connecting MeeGo Harmattan Devices}

            MeeGo Harmattan is a Linux-based software platform developed by
            Nokia and preinstalled on Nokia N950 and Nokia N9. It enables
            developers to create applications using the Qt framework.
            Use the SDK Connectivity tool that is preinstalled on the device to
            create the device-side end point for USB and WLAN connections.

        \o  \l{Connecting Maemo Devices}

            Maemo 5 (Fremantle) is a Linux-based software platform developed by
            Nokia and delivered on the Nokia N900. Use a connectivity tool (Mad
            Developer) to create the device-side end point for USB and WLAN
            connections.

        \o  \l{Connecting Symbian Devices}

            You can run Qt applications on Symbian devices if the software
            that Qt applications require (typically Qt, Qt Mobility, QtWebkit,
            and Open C) is installed on the device. On Symbian Anna and later
            devices, some version of Qt is pre-installed.
            Install and launch the CODA on-device debugging agent on the
            devices and connect the devices to the development PC.
