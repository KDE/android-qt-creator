    \title Publishing

    \image creator_publishing.png

    You can publish applications to app stores, such as Nokia Store, and other
    channels, such as Extras-devel for Maemo applications. Nokia Store is the
    global content market of Nokia that consumers can access directly from Nokia
    devices or through Web browsers.

    The process and requirements to publish Qt applications to Nokia Store are
    described in the
    \l {http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/Guide_to_Publishing_Qt_Applications_to_the_Ovi_Store}
    {Guide to Publishing Qt Applications to the Nokia Store} wiki.

        \o  \l{Publishing Qt Content for Symbian Devices}

            The \gui {Publish Qt Symbian Applications to Nokia Store}
            wizard ensures that your application can be published to Nokia
            Store by verifying that the the application UID, vendor name,
            and the capabilities used meet the Nokia Publish criteria.

        \o  \l{Publishing Qt Content for MeeGo Harmattan Devices}

            \QC generates installation packages that you can publish to
            Nokia Store. However, you must make sure that the packages meet
            the requirements of the Nokia Store.

        \o  \l{Publishing Qt Content for Maemo Devices}

            \QC generates installation packages that you can publish to
            Nokia Store. However, you must make sure that the packages meet
            the requirements of the Nokia Store.

        \o  \l{Publishing Maemo Applications to Extras-devel}

            You can use the \gui {Publish for Fremantle Extras-devel Free
            Repository} wizard to create a source archive and, optionally,
            upload it to a build server for compiling and packaging. The
            package is then moved to the Extras-devel repository that
            contains free Maemo applications.
