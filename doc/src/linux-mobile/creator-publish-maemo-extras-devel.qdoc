    \title Publishing Maemo Applications to Extras-devel

    Extras is the primary repository for Maemo applications where most
    community software can be found. You can browse the applications available
    in Extras at \l{http://maemo.org/downloads/Maemo5/}{Maemo Downloads}.

    You can publish both free and commercial applications to Extras. Free
    applications must be open source and pass through a QA process.
    Commercial applications are usually closed, binary only, and the publisher
    is responsible for assuring their quality and security.

    You can upload free applications as Debian packages to
    \l{http://wiki.maemo.org/Extras-devel}{Extras-devel} at Maemo.org to share
    new updates to your application and to start the community QA process.
    You need a \l{https://garage.maemo.org/}{Garage} account for the uploads,
    but the package itself does not need to be hosted in the Garage.

    You can use the \gui {Publish for Fremantle Extras-devel Free Repository}
    wizard to create a source archive and, optionally, upload it to a build
    server for compiling and packaging. The package is then moved to the
    Extras-devel repository. From there on, you must follow the standard
    Maemo processes to get the application published to Extras.

    The wizard checks that the package contains all the information that is
    required to publish applications on Extras: package description and
    Package Manager icon. For more information about entering this information,
    see \l{Creating Debian Installation Packages}.

    To use the publishing wizard:

    \list 1

        \o  Select the \gui {Maemo5} build target for your project.

        \o  Choose \gui {Build > Publish Project}.

        \o  Select \gui {Publish for Fremantle Extras-devel Free Repository},
            and then select \gui {Start Wizard}.

        \o  Select the Qt version and device type to build against and click
            \gui Next.

            To create a source archive without uploading it to the build
            server, select the \gui {Only create source package, do not upload}
            check box.

        \o  In the \gui {Garage account name} field, enter your login name, or
            select \gui {Get an account} to create a new account.

            You can also select \gui {Request upload rights} to use the Maemo
            Extras Assistant to validate your Garage account.

        \o  Select \gui Commit to publish the application.

    \endlist
