    \title Deploying Applications to Maemo or MeeGo Harmattan Devices

    You can specify settings for deploying applications to Maemo 5 and MeeGo
    Harmattan devices in the project .pro file. You can view the settings in the
    \gui {Run Settings}.

    \image qtcreator-maemo-deployment.png "Deploy to device"

    The files to be installed are listed in the \gui {Deploy to Device} step,
    the \gui {Files to install for subproject} field. The \gui {Local File Path}
    field displays the location of the file on the development PC. The
    \gui {Remote Directory} field displays the folder where the file is
    installed on the device. Text in red color indicates that the information is
    missing. Edit the qmake
    \l{http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qmake-variable-reference.html#installs}
    {INSTALLS variable} in the project .pro file to add the missing files.

    You can use desktop files to display icons on the home screen of the
    device. To add desktop files to the project file, select \gui {Add Desktop
    File}. To specify the icon file to display, select \gui {Add Launcher
    Icon}. To remove desktop files and icons, delete the definitions from
    the project file.

    If you develop your own libraries, \QC needs to be able to find them when
    you compile projects depending on them. When you install MADDE, an instance
    of the device file system, called sysroot, is installed to the development
    PC. Libraries are copied to sysroot during the \gui {Install Debian package
    to sysroot} step.

    \section1 Creating Debian Installation Packages

    When you run the application on the \gui{Maemo5} or \gui Harmattan target,
    \QC generates a Debian installation package in the build directory by
    default. You can deliver the installation package to users for installation
    on devices that are of the same type and run the same firmware as the
    connected device.

    \image qtcreator-maemo-deb-package.png "Create installation package"

    The name of the installation package is displayed in the \gui {Package name}
    field in the \gui {Create Package} step. You can change the version number
    in the \gui {Package version} field.

    You can specify information that users see on a delivery channel, such as
    Nokia Store or Maemo.org. You can specify a short description of the
    application, package name, and application icon.

    The Debian control file contains an application icon in encoded form. To add
    the application icon to the file, select it in the \gui {Icon to be
    displayed in Package Manager} field. For more information about icon files
    and adding them manually, see
    \l{ http://wiki.maemo.org/Packaging#Displaying_an_icon_in_the_Application_Manager_next_to_your_package}
    {Displaying an icon in the Application Manager next to your package}.

    \note \QC automates this process for you.

    \QC provides templates for a set of files that must be included in Debian
    packages. When you create a \gui Maemo5 or \gui Harmattan target for a
    project, \QC asks whether packaging files are to be added to the project and
    to version control. If you plan to edit the packaging files, add them to
    version control.

    To edit the files, select a file in \gui {Adapt Debian file} and click
    \gui Edit. The file opens in the text editor.
