    \title Publishing Qt Content for Maemo Devices

    The applications that you publish on Nokia Store, must meet the testing
    criteria listed in
    \l{http://www.developer.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/9cd1eb18-821b-4228-a0a3-36b049c5d608/Maemo_5_Application_OVI_Store_Entry_Requirements.pdf.html}
    {Maemo 5 Applications: Nokia Store Entry Requirements}.

    Make sure that your application passes the following most commonly
    failed test cases:

    \list

        \o  Package filename must include the application name and version
            number using three digits. For example: myapplication_1_0_1.deb

        \o  Application files must be installed to the opt folder on the ext3
            partition.

        \o  Debian packages must be given the category user/hidden.

        \o  Application cannot crash or hang during use.

        \o  The application must handle different memory situations correctly.

    \endlist

    You set the application name and installation folder in the
    \gui {Run Settings} for the project. For more information, see
    \l{Deploying Applications to Maemo or MeeGo Harmattan Devices}. \QC
    specifies the correct category settings by default when it creates the
    Debian directory and the necessary files.

    You can test the application on Qt Simulator and Maemo emulator to make
    sure that it does not crash or hang and to check how it handles different
    memory situations. Before you submit the application to Nokia Publish, you
    must also fully test it on a Maemo device.
