    \title Showing Task List Files in Issues Pane

    Code scanning and analysis tools create report files in ASCII format.
    Usually, the report files consist of lines that contain a file name, a line
    number, and an error message. A similar format is used for stack traces
    obtained from crash reports. Traditionally, you would fix the errors by
    manually navigating to them and correcting them, which is tedious.

    \QC makes this very easy by providing a way to load these files into
    the \gui{Issues} pane. You can navigate to the corresponding source
    code by clicking the error message. But first you must convert the files to
    the \l{Task List File Format} by using conversion scripts that based on
    standard text processing tools of the operating system.

    In addition, you can generate task list files from code. For an example of a
    script that checks new lines of code and matches them against regular
    expressions to generate a task list, see \c{scripts\mytasks.pl} in the \QC
    repository.

    To open task list files, choose \gui{File} > \gui{Open}.

    \section1 Task List File Format

    The filename extension must be .tasks for \QC to recognize a file as a
    task list file.

    Each line in a task list file is treated as a tab-separated list of strings
    with \c{\t}, \c{\n}, and \c{\\} used as escape characters. The strings are
    used to create one task per line. The lines can have one of the following
    formats:

    \list

        \o  \c description

        \o  \c{type\tdescription}

        \o  \c{file\ttype\tdescription}

        \o  \c{file\tline\ttype\tdescription}

    \endlist

    The task type can have one of the following values:

    \list

        \o  A string starting with \c err, which displays the error icon in the
            beginning of the line

        \o  A string starting with \c warn, which displays the warning icon

        \o  Any other value, which sets the task type to Unknown and does not
            display an icon

    \endlist

    The values are not case sensitive.

    Lines starting with the hash mark character (#) in the first column are
    ignored.
