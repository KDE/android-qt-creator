    \section1 Setting Up Version Control Systems

    \QC uses the version control system's command line clients to access your
    repositories. To allow access, make sure that the command line clients can
    be located using the \c{PATH} environment variable or specify the path to
    the command line client executables in \gui{Tools} > \gui{Options} >
    \gui {Version Control}.

    After you set up the version control system, use the command line to check
    that everything works (for example, use the status command). If no issues
    arise, you should be ready to use the system also from \QC.

    \section2 Using msysGit on Windows

    If you configure Git for use with \c {git bash}, only, and use SSH
    authorization, Git looks for the SSH keys in the directory where the
    \c HOME environment points to. The variable is always set by \c {git bash}.

    However, the variable is typically not set in a Windows command prompt. When
    you run Git from a Windows command prompt, it looks for the SSH keys in its
    installation directory, and therefore, the authorization fails.

    You can set the \c HOME environment variable from \QC. Select \gui {Tools >
    Options > Version Control > Git}. Select the \gui {Environment Variables}
    and the \gui {Set "HOME" environment variable} check boxes. \c HOME is set
    to \c %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% when the Git executable is run and authorization
    works as it would with \c {git bash}.

    \section1 Setting Up Common Options

    Select \gui{Tools} > \gui{Options} > \gui{Version Control} > \gui{Common}
    to specify settings for submit messages:

    \list

        \o  \gui{Submit message check script} is a script or program that
            can be used to perform checks on the submit message before
            submitting. The submit message is passed in as the script's first
            parameter. If there is an error, the script should output a
            message on standard error and return a non-zero exit code.

        \o  \gui{User/alias configuration file} takes a file in mailmap format
            that lists user names and aliases. For example:

            \code
            Jon Doe <Jon.Doe@company.com>
            Hans Mustermann <Hans.Mustermann@company.com> hm <info@company.com>
            \endcode

            \note The second line above specifies the alias \e{hm} and the
            corresponding email address for \e{Hans Mustermann}. If the
            user/alias configuration file is present, the submit editor
            displays a context menu with \gui{Insert name} that pops up a
            dialog letting the user select a name.

        \o  \gui{User fields configuration file} is a simple text file
            consisting of lines specifying submit message fields that take
            user names, for example:

            \code
            Reviewed-by:
            Signed-off-by:
            \endcode

            The fields above appear below the submit message. They provide
            completion for the aliases/public user names specified in the
            \e{User/alias configuration file} as well as a button that opens the
            aforementioned user name dialog.

        \o  \gui{SSH prompt command} specifies an ssh-askpass command that you
            can use (on Linux) to prompt the user for a password when using SSH.
            For example, \c ssh-askpass or \c x11-ssh-askpass, depending on the
            ssh-askpass implementation that you use.

    \endlist

    \section1 Creating VCS Repositories for New Projects

    \QC allows you to create repositories for version control systems that
    support local repository creation, such as Git, Mercurial, or Bazaar.
    When creating a new project by selecting \gui File > \gui{New File or
    Project}, you can choose a version control system on the final wizard page.

    You can also select \gui Tools and then select \gui {Create Repository}
    in the submenu for the version control system.

    To import a project that is under version control, choose \gui {File >
    New File or Project > Project from Version Control} and select the
    version control system that you use. Follow the instructions of the
    wizard to import the project.

    \section1 Using Version Control Systems

    The \gui{Tools} menu contains a submenu for each supported version
    control system.

    The \gui{Version Control} output pane displays the commands that are
    executed, a timestamp, and the relevant output. Select \gui {Window > Output
    Panes > Version Control} to open the pane.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-pane.png

    \section2 Adding Files

    When you create a new file or a new project, the wizard displays a page
    asking whether the files should be added to a version control system.
    This happens when the parent directory or the project is already
    under version control and the system supports the concept of adding files,
    for example, Perforce and Subversion. Alternatively, you can
    add files later by using the version control tool menus.

    With Git, there is no concept of adding files. Instead, all modified
    files must be staged for a commit.

    \section2 Viewing Diff Output

    All version control systems provide menu options to \e{diff} the current
    file or project: to compare it with the latest version stored in the
    repository and to display the differences. In \QC, a diff is displayed in a
    read-only editor. If the file is accessible, you can double-click on a
    selected diff chunk and \QC opens an editor displaying the file, scrolled to
    the line in question.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-diff.png

    \section2 Viewing Versioning History and Change Details

    Display the versioning history of a file by selecting \gui{Log}
    or \gui{Filelog}. Typically, the log output contains the date, the commit
    message, and a change or revision identifier. Click on the identifier to
    display a description of the change including the diff.
    Right-clicking on an identifier brings up a context menu that lets you
    show annotation views of previous versions (see \l{Annotating Files}).

    \image qtcreator-vcs-log.png

    \section2 Annotating Files

    Annotation views are obtained by selecting \gui{Annotate} or \gui{Blame}.
    Selecting \gui{Annotate} or \gui{Blame} displays the lines of the file
    prepended by the change identifier they originate from. Clicking on the
    change identifier shows a detailed description of the change.

    To show the annotation of a previous version, right-click on the
    version identifier at the beginning of a line and choose one of the
    revisions shown at the bottom of the context menu. This allows you to
    navigate through the history of the file and obtain previous versions of
    it. It also works for Git and Mercurial using SHA's.

    The same context menu is available when right-clicking on a version
    identifier in the file log view of a single file.

    \section2 Committing Changes

    Once you have finished making changes, submit them to the version control
    system by choosing \gui{Commit} or \gui{Submit}. \QC displays a
    commit page containing a text editor where you can enter your commit
    message and a checkable list of modified files to be included.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-commit.png

    When you have finished filling out the commit page information, click on
    \gui{Commit} to start committing.

    The \gui{Diff Selected Files} button brings up a diff view of the
    files selected in the file list. Since the commit page is just another
    editor, you can go back to it by closing the diff view. You can also check
    a diff view from the editor combo box showing the \gui{Opened files}.

    \section2 Reverting Changes

    All supported version control system support reverting your project to
    known states. This functionality is generally called \e reverting.

    The changes discarded depend on the version control system.

    A version control system can replace the \gui Revert menu option with other
    options.

    \section3 Reverting Changes Using Git

    The Git version control system has an index that is used to stage
    changes. The index is commited on the next commit. Git allows you to revert
    back to the state of the last commit as well as to the state staged in the
    index.

    \list

        \o  \gui{Undo Unstaged Changes} reverts all changes and resets the
            working directory to the state of the index.

        \o  \gui{Undo Uncommitted Changes} reverts all changes, discarding the
            index. This returns your working copy to the state it was in right
            after the last commit.

    \endlist

    \section2 Viewing Status

    You can select \gui{Status} to view the status of the project or
    repository.

    \section2 Updating the Working Tree

    You can select \gui Update to update your working tree with the latest
    changes from the branch. Some version control systems allow you to choose
    between updating the current project and updating all projects.

    With Git, you stash your changes and then pull the changes from the
    repository.

    \section2 Deleting Files

    You can select \gui Delete to delete obsolete files from the repository.

    With Git, you delete the files from the working tree and then stage the
    deleted files for a commit.

    \section2 Using Additional Bazaar Functions

    Bazaar is a free version control system sponsored by Canonical.

    The \gui Bazaar submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
        \header
            \o  Menu Item
            \o  Description
        \row
            \i  \gui{Pull}
            \i  Turn the branch into a mirror of another branch.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Push}
            \i  Update a mirror of the branch.

    \endtable

    \section2 Using Additional CVS Functions

    CVS is an open source version control system.

    The \gui CVS submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
        \header
            \o  Menu Item
            \o  Description
        \row
            \i  \gui{Edit}
            \i  Open a file for editing.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Push}
            \i  Push changes to the remote repository.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Unedit}
            \i  Discard the changes that you made in a file.

    \endtable

    \section2 Using Additional Git Functions

    Git is a fast decentralized version control system. Git is available
    for Windows, Linux and Mac.

    The \gui Git submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
        \header
            \o  Menu Item
            \o  Description
        \row
            \i  \gui {Patch > Apply from Editor/Apply from File}
            \i  Patches are rewriting instructions that can be applied to a set
                of files. You can either apply a patch file that is open in \QC
                or select the patch file to apply from the file system.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Pull}
            \i  Pull changes from the remote repository. If there are locally
                modified files, you are prompted to stash those changes. Select
                \gui{Tools > Options > Version Control > Git} and select the
                \gui {Pull with rebase} check box to perform a rebase operation
                while pulling.

        \row
            \i  \gui{Clean/Clean Project}
            \i  All files that are not under version control (with the exception
                of patches and project files) are displayed in the \gui {Clean
                Repository} dialog. Select the files to delete and click
                \gui Delete. This allows you to clean a build completely.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Launch gitk}
            \i  Start the commit viewer for Git, gitk.
        \row

            \i  Store local changes temporarily.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Amend Last Commit}
            \i  Revert the last commit.

    \endtable

    \section3 Working with Branches

    To work with Git branches, select \gui{Branches}. The checked out branch
    is shown in bold and underlined in the list of branches. Double-click branch
    names to edit them.

    \image qtcreator-vcs-gitbranch.png "Branches dialog"

    The following operations are supported:

    \table
        \header
            \o  Menu Item
            \o  Description
        \row
            \i  \gui{Add}
            \i  Create new tracking and non-tracking branches.
        \row

        \row
            \i  \gui{Refresh}
            \i  Refresh the list of branches.
    \endtable

    \section3 Working with Remote Repositories

    To manage remote repositories available in Git, select \gui{Remotes}.
    Double-click the names and URLs of the remote repositories to edit them.

    The following operations are supported:

    \table
        \header
            \o  Menu Item
            \o  Description
        \row
            \i  \gui{Add}

        \row
            \i  \gui{Refresh}
            \i  Refresh the list of remote repositories.
    \endtable


    \section3 Using Stashes

    With Git, you can put your current set of changes onto a virtual shelf
    called a \e stash. Stashes are useful, for example, to put aside a set of
    changes to work on higher priority tasks or to pull in new chages from
    another repository.

    \QC exposes this functionality in the \gui{Tools > Git > Stash} menu.

    \table
        \header
            \o  Menu Item
            \o  Description
        \row
            \i  \gui{Stashes}
            \i  Display a dialog that shows all known stashes with options to
                restore, display or delete them.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Stash}
            \i  Stash all local changes. The working copy is then reset to
                the state it had right after the last commit.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Stash Snapshot}
            \i  Save a snapshot of your current work under a name for later
                reference. The working copy is unchanged.

                For example, if you want to try something and find out later
                that it does not work, you can discard it and return to the
                state of the snapshot.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Stash Pop}
            \i  Remove a single stashed state from the stash list and apply it
                on top of the current working tree state.
    \endtable

    \section2 Using Additional Mercurial Functionality

    Mercurial is a free, distributed source control management tool.

    The \gui Mercurial submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
        \header
            \o  Menu Item
            \o  Description
        \row
            \i  \gui{Import}
            \i  Apply changes from a patch file.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Incoming}
            \i  Monitor the status of a remote repository by listing
                the changes that will be pulled.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Outgoing}
            \i  Monitor the status of a remote repository by listing
                the changes that will be pushed.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Pull}
            \i  Pull changes from the remote repository.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Push}
            \i  Push changes to the remote repository.
     \endtable

    \section2 Using Additional Perforce Functions

    Perforce is a fast software configuration management system developed by
    Perforce Software.

    When you start \QC, it looks for the executable specified
    in the \gui{P4 command} field in \gui{Tools > Options > Version
    Control > Perforce}. If the file is not found, the following error
    message is displayed in the \gui {Version Control} output pane:
    \gui {Perforce: Unable to determine the repository: "p4.exe"
    terminated with exit code 1}. If you use Perforce, check that the
    path to the executable is specified correctly in the \gui{P4 command}
    field.

    If you do not use Perforce, you can disable the Perforce plugin to
    get rid of the error message. Choose \gui {Help > About Plugins} and
    deselect the \gui Load check box for the \gui Perforce plugin in the
    \gui {Version Control} group.

    The \gui Perforce submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
        \header
            \o  Menu Item
            \o  Description
        \row
            \i  \gui{Describe}
            \i  View information about changelists and the files in them.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Edit File}
            \i  Open a file for editing.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Opened}
            \i  List files that are open for editing.
        \row
            \i  \gui{Pending Changes}
            \i  Group files for commit.
    \endtable

    \section2 Using Additional Subversion Functions

    Subversion is an open source version control system.

    The \gui Subversion submenu contains the following additional items:

    \table
