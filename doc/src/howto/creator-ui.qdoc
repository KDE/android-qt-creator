    \title User Interface

    \image qtcreator-breakdown.png

    When you start \QC, it opens to the \gui Welcome mode, where you can:

    \list

        \o  Read news from the Qt labs

        \o  Open tutorials and example projects

        \o  Create and open projects

        \o  Send feedback to the development team

        \o  Open recent sessions and projects

    \endlist

    You can use the mode selector to change to another \QC mode.
    The following image displays an example application in \gui Edit mode
    and \gui Design mode.

    \image qtcreator-qt-quick-editors.png "Edit mode and Design mode"

    \QC has been localized into several languages. If the system language is one
    of the supported languages, it is automatically selected. To change the
    language, select \gui {Tools > Options > Environment} and select a language
    in the \gui Language field. The change takes effect after you restart \QC.

    \section1 Modes

    The mode selector allows you to quickly switch between tasks such as editing
    project and source files, designing application UIs, configuring how
    projects are built and executed, and debugging your applications. To change
    modes, click the icons, or use the \l{keyboard-shortcuts}
    {corresponding keyboard shortcut}.

    You can use \QC in the following modes:

    \list

        \o  \gui Welcome mode for opening projects.

        \o  \gui{\l{Using the Editor}{Edit}} mode for editing project and source
            files.

        \o  \gui{\l{Developing Application UI}{Design}} mode for designing and
            developing application user interfaces. This mode is available for
            UI files.

        \o  \gui{\l{Debugging}{Debug}} mode for inspecting the state of your
            application while debugging.

        \o  \gui{\l{Specifying Build Settings}{Projects}} mode for configuring
            project building and execution. This mode is available when a
            project is open.

        \o  \gui{\l{Analyzing Code}{Analyze}} mode for using code analysis tools
            to detect memory leaks and profile C++ or QML code.

        \o  \gui{\l{Getting Help}{Help}} mode for viewing Qt documentation.

    \endlist

    Certain actions in \QC trigger a mode change. Clicking on \gui {Debug} >
    \gui {Start Debugging} > \gui {Start Debugging} automatically switches to
    \gui {Debug} mode.

    \section1 Browsing Project Contents

    The sidebar is available in the \gui Edit and \gui Debug modes. Use the
    sidebar to browse projects, files, and bookmarks, and to view the class
    hierarchy.

    \image qtcreator-sidebar.png

    You can select the content of the sidebar in the sidebar menu:

    \list

        \o  \gui Projects shows a list of projects open in the current
            session.

        \o  \gui{Open Documents} shows currently open files.

        \o  \gui Bookmarks shows all bookmarks for the current session.

        \o  \gui{File System} shows all files in the currently selected
             directory.

        \o  \gui {Class View} shows the class hierarchy of the currently
            open projects.

        \o  \gui Outline shows the symbol hierachy of a C++ file and the element
            hierarchy of a QML file.

        \o  \gui {Type Hierarchy} shows the base classes of a class.

    \endlist

    You can change the view of the sidebar in the following ways:

    \list

        \o  To toggle the sidebar, click \inlineimage qtcreator-togglebutton.png
            or press \key Alt+0 (\key Cmd+0 on Mac OS X).

        \o  To split the sidebar, click \inlineimage qtcreator-splitbar.png
            . Select new content to view in the split view.

    \endlist

    The additional options in each view are described in the following
    sections.

    \section2 Viewing Project Files

    The sidebar displays projects in a project tree. The project tree contains
    a list of all projects open in the current session. The files for each
    project are grouped according to their file type.

    You can use the project tree in the following ways:

    \list

        \o  To bring up a context menu containing the actions most commonly
            needed right-click an item in the project tree. For example, through
            the menu of the project root directory you can, among other actions,
            build, re-build, clean and run the project.

        \o  To hide the categories and sort project files alphabetically, click
            \inlineimage qtcreator-filter.png
            and select \gui{Simplify Tree}.

        \o  To hide source files which are automatically generated by the build
            system, during a build, click \inlineimage qtcreator-filter.png
            and select \gui{Hide Generated Files}.

        \o  To keep the position in the project tree synchronized with the file
            currently opened in the editor, click
            \inlineimage qtcreator-synchronizefocus.png
            .
