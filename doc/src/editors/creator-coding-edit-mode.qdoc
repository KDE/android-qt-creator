    \title Working in Edit Mode

    This section describes how to use the \gui Edit mode. For more information
    about using the sidebar, see \l{Browsing Project Contents}.

    \section1 Using the Editor Toolbar

    The editor toolbar is located at the top of the editor view. The editor
    toolbar is context sensitive and shows items relevant to the file currently
    open in the editor.

    Use the toolbar to navigate between open files and symbols in use.
    To browse forward or backward through your location history, click
    \inlineimage qtcreator-back.png
    and \inlineimage qtcreator-forward.png
    .

    To go to any open file, select it from the \gui{Open files} drop-down menu.
    Right-click the menu title and select \gui {Copy Full Path to Clipboard} to
    copy the path and name of the current file to the clipboard.

    To jump to any symbol used in the current file, select it from the
    \gui Symbols drop-down menu. By default, the symbols are displayed in the
    order in which they appear in the file. Right-click the menu title and
    select \gui {Sort Alphabetically} to arrange the symbols in alphabetic
    order.

    \section1 Splitting the Editor View

    Split the editor view when you want to work on and view multiple files on
    the same screen.

    You can split the editor view in the following ways:

    \list

        \o  To split the editor view into a top and bottom view, select
            \gui Window > \gui Split or press \key{Ctrl+E, 2}.

            Split command creates views below the currently active editor view.

        \o  To split the editor view into adjacent views, select
            \gui Window > \gui{Split Side by Side} or press \key{Ctrl+E, 3}.

           Side by side split command creates views to the right of the
           currently active editor view.

    \endlist

    To move between split views, select \gui Window > \gui{Go to Next Split} or
    press \key{Ctrl+E, O}.

    To remove a split view, place the cursor within the view you want to
    remove and select \gui Window > \gui{Remove Current Split} or press
    \key{Ctrl+E, 0}. To remove all but the currently selected split view,
    select \gui Window > \gui{Remove All Splits} or press \key{Ctrl+E, 1}.

    \section1 Using Bookmarks

    To insert or delete a bookmark right-click the line number and select
    \gui{Toggle Bookmark} or press \key{Ctrl+M}.

    \image qtcreator-togglebookmark.png

    To go to previous bookmark in the current session, press \key{Ctrl+,}.

    To go to next bookmark in the current session, press \key{Ctrl+.}.

    \section1 Moving to Symbol Definition or Declaration

    You can move directly to the definition or the declaration of a symbol by
    holding the \key Ctrl and clicking the symbol.

    To enable this moving function, in \gui Tools > \gui{Options} >
    \gui{Text Editor} > \gui Behavior, select \gui{Enable mouse navigation}.

    You can also select the symbol and press \key F2, or right-click the symbol
    and select \gui {Follow Symbol Under Cursor} to move to its definition or
    declaration. This feature is supported for namespaces, classes, methods,
    variables, include statements, and macros.

    To switch between the definition and declaration of a symbol, press
    \key {Shift+F2} or right-click the symbol and select \gui {Switch Between
    Method Declaration/Definition}.

    \section1 Using Update Code Model

    To refresh the internal information in \QC pertaining to your code,
    select \gui{Tools} > \gui{C++} > \gui{Update Code Model}.

    \note In \QC indexing updates the code automatically. Use
    \gui{Update Code Model} only as an emergency command.
