    \title Editing MIME Types

    \QC uses the \l{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type}
    {Internet media type} (MIME type) of the file to determine which mode and
    editor to use for opening the file. For example, \QC opens C++ source and
    header files in the C++ editor, and Qt widget based UI files (.ui) in \QD.

    To identify the MIME type of a file, \QC uses matching by pattern and
    matching by contents. First, \QC looks at the filename to check whether it
    matches the patterns specified for any MIME type. If no match is found, it
    checks the contents of the file for magic headers specified for the file.

    The magic headers can contain text strings or bytes. The type of the header
    value, string or byte, determines how \QC interprets the value. \QC
    searches for the value within a specified range in the files and takes the
    priority of the magic header into account. If you specify wide search
    ranges, openging files in \QC might take a long time. Therefore, you are
    advised to use the recommended values for the range and priority of the
    magic header.

    If your files do not match the predefined MIME types, you can edit the
    MIME types to add filename extensions and magic headers. You cannot add
    new MIME types, however.

    To edit MIME types:

    \list 1

        \o  Select \gui {Tools > Options > Environment > MIME Types}.

            \image qtcreator-mime-types.png "MIME Types"

        \o  In \gui {MIME Type}, select a MIME type.

        \o  In \gui Patterns, add the filename extension for the type of files
            that you want to identify as having this MIME type.

        \o  Click \gui Add to add \gui {Magic Headers}.

            \image qtcreator-mime-types-magic-header.png "Magic Header"

        \o  In the \gui Value field, specify a text string or bytes that
            appear in the files.

        \o  In the \gui Type field, select the type of the value.

            \note You are recommended not to change the range and priority,
            because it might cause problems when opening files in \QC.

        \o  Click \gui OK.

    \endlist

    To revert all the changes you have made to the MIME type definitions,
    select \gui {Reset All}.

    \note If you now select \gui OK or \gui Apply, you permanently lose all
    your own patterns and magic headers. The changes are reverted the next
    time you start \QC.
